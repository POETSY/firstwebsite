  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p><I><strong>Poetry</strong></I>, literature that evokes a concentrated<br>
  imaginative <strong>awareness of experience</strong> or <strong>
  a specific emotional response</strong><br>
  through language chosen and arranged for its meaning, sound, and rhythm.</p>

  <img src= "coding.jpg" width = "100%">
  <p>Poetry is a vast subject, as old as history and older,<br>
  present wherever religion is present, possibly—under some definitions—the primal<br>
  and primary form of languages themselves. </p>
  <p>The present article means only to describe in as general<br>
  a way as possible certain properties of poetry<br>
   and of poetic thought regarded as in some sense independent modes of the mind.<br>
  Naturally, not every tradition nor every local or individual variation<br>
  can be—or need be—included, but the article illustrates
  by examples of poetry ranging between nursery rhyme and epic.<br>
  This article considers the difficulty or impossibility of defining poetry;<br>
  man’s nevertheless familiar acquaintance with it;<br>
  the differences between poetry and prose;<br>
   the idea of form in poetry; poetry as a mode of thought;<br>
   and what little may be said in prose of the spirit of poetry.</p>
